## üìÑ Overview

**ASCIIShapes OOP Demo**, developed by Adrian Lesniak, is a C++ console application designed to showcase fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, particularly **abstraction** and **polymorphism**. It defines an abstract base class `Figura` (Shape) with a pure virtual `rysuj()` (draw) method. Concrete derived classes `Kolo` (Circle), `Kwadrat` (Square), and `Trojkat` (Triangle) override this method to print their respective simple ASCII art representations to the console. The program also demonstrates setting a Polish locale (`pl_PL.UTF-8`) to ensure correct display of Polish characters in its output messages.

## ‚ú® Key OOP Concepts & Features

*   üèõÔ∏è **Abstract Base Class (`Figura`)**:
    *   Defines a common interface for all shapes.
    *   Contains a **pure virtual function** `virtual void rysuj() const = 0;`, making `Figura` an abstract class that cannot be instantiated directly.
    *   Includes a virtual destructor `virtual ~Figura() {}` for proper cleanup when dealing with derived objects through base class pointers.
*   üî∂‚ö™‚¨ú **Derived Concrete Classes**:
    *   **`Kolo` (Circle)**: Inherits from `Figura` and overrides `rysuj()` to print a circle representation (e.g., `()`).
    *   **`Kwadrat` (Square)**: Inherits from `Figura` and overrides `rysuj()` to print a square representation (e.g., `[]`).
    *   **`Trojkat` (Triangle)**: Inherits from `Figura` and overrides `rysuj()` to print a triangle representation (e.g., `/\\`).
*   üîÑ **Polymorphism in Action**:
    *   Objects of derived classes (`Kolo`, `Kwadrat`, `Trojkat`) are dynamically allocated and stored as `Figura*` (pointers to the base class).
    *   The correct `rysuj()` method for each specific shape is called at runtime due to virtual function dispatch, demonstrating polymorphism.
*   üáµüá± **Localization (Polish Language Support)**:
    *   `setPolishLocale()`: A function that attempts to set the global C++ locale to `pl_PL.UTF-8` using `std::locale::global(std::locale("pl_PL.UTF-8"));`. This allows the program to correctly display Polish diacritics (e.g., "≈Ç" in "ko≈Ço", "ƒÖ" in "tr√≥jkƒÖt") in its console output, provided the system and terminal support this locale and encoding.
*   üß† **Dynamic Memory Management**:
    *   Shape objects are created on the heap using `new`.
    *   Memory is explicitly deallocated using `delete` to prevent memory leaks.

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots (Conceptual Output)

The program does not have an interactive UI but produces direct console output.

**Expected Console Output:**
*To jest ko≈Ço: ()*
*To jest kwadrat: []*
*To jest tr√≥jkƒÖt: /\*

*(The exact Polish phrases like "To jest ko≈Ço" might vary based on implementation but demonstrate the locale setting.)*

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

*   **Operating System**: Any OS supporting a C++ compiler and the `pl_PL.UTF-8` locale (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS). The terminal used must also support UTF-8 rendering for Polish characters to display correctly.
*   **C++ Compiler**: A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later (e.g., g++, clang++, MSVC).
*   **Standard C++ Libraries**: `<iostream>` (for console I/O), `<vector>` (if used for storing shapes, though the example implies individual pointers), `<string>` (if used), `<locale>` (for setting the locale).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable)**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` if this code is part of a larger repository).*

2.  **Save Main Code**:
    Ensure your C++ source code (containing the `Figura` abstract class, derived shape classes, `setPolishLocale` function, and `main` function) is saved as `shapes.cpp` (or your chosen file name) in your project directory.

3.  **Compile the Program**:
    Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, Bash, etc.) in the project directory.
    **Example using g++:**
    ```bash
    g++ shapes.cpp -o shapes -std=c++11
    ```
    *(Add `-static-libgcc -static-libstdc++` on Windows with MinGW if desired for standalone executables. Add optimization flags like `-O2` for release builds if needed).*

4.  **Run the Program**:
    *   On Windows: `.\shapes.exe` or `shapes.exe`
    *   On Linux/macOS: `./shapes` (ensure execute permissions: `chmod +x shapes`)

## üí° Usage Guide

1.  Compile `shapes.cpp` as detailed in the "Installation and Setup" section.
2.  Run the compiled executable (`shapes` or `shapes.exe`).
3.  **Output**:
    *   The program will directly print the ASCII representations of a circle, a square, and a triangle to the console, each preceded by a descriptive Polish phrase (e.g., "To jest ko≈Ço: ()").
4.  **Actions**:
    *   Observe the console output to see the shapes and verify that Polish characters (if any in your specific output strings like "tr√≥jkƒÖt") are displayed correctly.
    *   The program runs a fixed sequence and then terminates. There are no interactive prompts.
    *   To experiment, you can modify the `rysuj()` methods in the derived classes to change the ASCII art or add new shape classes inheriting from `Figura`.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

*   `shapes.cpp`: The main (and likely only) C++ source file containing all class definitions (`Figura`, `Kolo`, `Kwadrat`, `Trojkat`), the `setPolishLocale` function, and the `main()` function.
*   `README.md`: This documentation file.

*(No external data files, log files, or user-provided header files are indicated for this specific program as described.)*

## üìù Technical Notes

*   **Polish Locale (`pl_PL.UTF-8`)**: The success of `setPolishLocale()` depends on the operating system having support for this specific locale installed and the terminal being configured to correctly interpret and render UTF-8 encoded characters. If the locale is not supported, `std::locale::global` might throw an exception or have no effect.
*   **Polymorphism**: The core educational value lies in how `fig[i]->rysuj()` calls the correct derived class's version of `rysuj()` due to it being a virtual function.
*   **Memory Management**: The use of `new` for dynamic allocation necessitates corresponding `delete` calls for each allocated object to prevent memory leaks. Smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`) could be a more modern C++ approach for automatic memory management if the collection of shapes were more complex or long-lived.
*   **Simplicity of ASCII Art**: The current ASCII representations are very basic (`()`, `[]`, `/\\`). This can be easily extended within each `rysuj()` method for more elaborate drawings.
*   **Fixed Sequence**: The program executes a predefined sequence of creating and drawing three shapes. It's not interactive beyond observing the output.
